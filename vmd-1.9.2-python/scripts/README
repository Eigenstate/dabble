  These are the initialization scripts used by Tcl, TclX, TclDP as     
well as the core VMD routines.  The 'vmd' startup script should set
several environment variables as follows:
  TCL_LIBRARY    $VMDDIR/scripts/tcl
  TCLX_LIBRARY   $VMDDIR/scripts/tclX
  DP_LIBRARY     $VMDDIR/scripts/dp
and the vmd scripts are in
                 $VMDDIR/scripts/vmd
