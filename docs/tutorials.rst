Tutorials
=========

Here are some tutorials about how to do things related to system
building, parameterization, and getting all the files you need to run Dabble.

These tutorials are adopted from material available on the internet and what
I (Robin) have learned over the course of my PhD. Please check your work
carefully, and validate all simulation results.

Covalently modified amino acids
-------------------------------

`Amber format <https://robinbetz.com/blog/2016/11/28/parameterizing-an-isopeptide-bond/>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This blog post will help you parameterize and set up a system with an
isopeptide bond between two distant amino acids, using AMBER parameters.

:ref:`Charmm format`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This tutorial will walk you through parameterizing adipocyte lipid binding
protein with a covalently linked phenanthroline, using CHARMM patches.
